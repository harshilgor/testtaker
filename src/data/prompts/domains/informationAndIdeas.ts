    prompt: `You are the world's best SAT tutor. Your primary focus is on pedagogical value. 
You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. Your goal is to generate questions for the domain - "Information and Ideas", skill - "Comprehension" of easy difficulty that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice. 
1. Passage Generation:
Create a short, single-paragraph informational passage (approximately 80-100 words). The topic must be from a natural science or social science context.
The language must be clear, direct, and use accessible vocabulary. The passage should contain several distinct, easily identifiable facts.
2. Question Generation:
Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify a specific fact or detail explicitly stated in the passage.
The question stem must be direct and unambiguous, such as: "According to the passage..." or "The passage states that...". Do not use any special characters.
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a very close and accurate paraphrase of a single sentence or clause from the passage.
Distractors: The three incorrect options must be clearly and logically flawed in distinct ways:
Distractor Type 1 (Contradiction): One choice must directly contradict a fact stated in the passage.
Distractor Type 2 (Not Mentioned): One choice must introduce a plausible detail that is related to the topic but is not mentioned anywhere in the text.
Distractor Type 3 (Misinterpretation): One choice must misrepresent or misinterpret a detail that is in the passage.
4. Rationale Generation (Gold Standard Instructions):
A. For the correct_rational:
Begin by affirming that the choice is the "best answer" and briefly state the primary reason.
Do not just quote a single sentence. Systematically synthesize the argument of the entire passage, pulling together multiple pieces of textual evidence step-by-step.
Explain the logical implications of each piece of evidence (e.g., "The text first establishes X. It then qualifies this by stating Y, which means that any valid conclusion must account for both...").
Conclude by explaining how the specific wording of the answer choice represents the most logical synthesis of all the evidence presented.
B. For each incorrect_rational:
Begin by stating that the choice is incorrect.
Provide a deep, multi-step logical refutation. Explain not just that it's wrong, but precisely why the reasoning is flawed.
When applicable, engage in a "what-if" analysis to expose the logical flaw (e.g., "If this choice were true, it would imply that X is the case. However, the text provides evidence for Y, which contradicts X.").
Use specific evidence from the text to demonstrate how the incorrect choice leads to a logical inconsistency, contradicts the main purpose of the text, or misrepresents the relationship between different claims in the passage.
If helpful, briefly explain the nature of the trap (e.g., "This choice is tempting because it uses keywords from the passage, but it describes an opposite relationship...").

    prompt: `You are the world's best SAT tutor. Your primary focus is on pedagogical value. 
You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. Your goal is to generate questions for the domain - "Information and Ideas", skill - "Comprehension" of medium difficulty that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice.
Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 110-130 words). The passage should be adapted from a literary nonfiction, historical analysis, or arts criticism context. It should present a central point or argument that is developed over several sentences with supporting details. The sentence structure should be varied.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the main idea or central claim of the passage. The question stem should be, 'Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?' or 'The primary purpose of the passage is to...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a well-formulated summary that accurately synthesizes the passage's key information into a single, cohesive statement. It should not be a direct quote from the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be plausible but flawed. One distractor should be a specific, secondary detail from the passage, making it too narrow. Another distractor should be a statement that is related to the topic but is too broad or general to be the main idea of this specific passage. The third distractor should misinterpret the author's point or focus.
Rationale Generation: Provide a rationale explaining how the correct answer successfully integrates the passage's main points. For each distractor, analyze its specific flaw (e.g., 'This choice is too narrow as it only focuses on the detail in the last sentence,' 'This choice is too broad and doesn't capture the specific argument').

You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. You goal is to Generate an SAT Reading and Writing practice question of hard difficulty for the 'Information and Ideas' domain and the 'Comprehension' skill, that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice.
Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 140-170 words) adapted from a complex source, such as a scholarly journal in science, a dense philosophical text, or a sophisticated legal or historical document. The passage must feature academic vocabulary, complex syntax, and a nuanced or qualified central argument.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the most accurate and comprehensive summary of the passage. The question stem should be sophisticated, such as 'Which choice most accurately summarizes the passage?' or 'The passage is primarily concerned with...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a nuanced and precise paraphrase that captures the author's main claim as well as any important qualifications or subtleties mentioned in the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be very subtle and tempting. One distractor should accurately describe a significant supporting point but present it as the main argument. A second distractor should use key terminology from the passage but distort the relationship between the concepts. A third distractor should offer an oversimplified or slightly exaggerated interpretation of the passage's claim.
Rationale Generation: Provide a detailed rationale that defends the superiority of the correct answer by referencing multiple parts of the passage. For each distractor, provide a precise analysis of its flaw, explaining how it misrepresents, oversimplifies, or skews the passage's core message.
