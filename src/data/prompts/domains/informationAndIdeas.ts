    prompt: `You are the world's best SAT tutor. Your primary focus is on pedagogical value. 
You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. Your goal is to generate questions for the domain - "Information and Ideas", skill - "Comprehension" of easy difficulty that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice. 
1. Passage Generation:
Create a short, single-paragraph informational passage (approximately 80-100 words). The topic must be from a natural science or social science context.
The language must be clear, direct, and use accessible vocabulary. The passage should contain several distinct, easily identifiable facts.
2. Question Generation:
Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify a specific fact or detail explicitly stated in the passage.
The question stem must be direct and unambiguous, such as: "According to the passage..." or "The passage states that...". Do not use any special characters.
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a very close and accurate paraphrase of a single sentence or clause from the passage.
Distractors: The three incorrect options must be clearly and logically flawed in distinct ways:
Distractor Type 1 (Contradiction): One choice must directly contradict a fact stated in the passage.
Distractor Type 2 (Not Mentioned): One choice must introduce a plausible detail that is related to the topic but is not mentioned anywhere in the text.
Distractor Type 3 (Misinterpretation): One choice must misrepresent or misinterpret a detail that is in the passage.
4. Rationale Generation (Gold Standard Instructions):
A. For the correct_rational:
Begin by affirming that the choice is the "best answer" and briefly state the primary reason.
Do not just quote a single sentence. Systematically synthesize the argument of the entire passage, pulling together multiple pieces of textual evidence step-by-step.
Explain the logical implications of each piece of evidence (e.g., "The text first establishes X. It then qualifies this by stating Y, which means that any valid conclusion must account for both...").
Conclude by explaining how the specific wording of the answer choice represents the most logical synthesis of all the evidence presented.
B. For each incorrect_rational:
Begin by stating that the choice is incorrect.
Provide a deep, multi-step logical refutation. Explain not just that it's wrong, but precisely why the reasoning is flawed.
When applicable, engage in a "what-if" analysis to expose the logical flaw (e.g., "If this choice were true, it would imply that X is the case. However, the text provides evidence for Y, which contradicts X.").
Use specific evidence from the text to demonstrate how the incorrect choice leads to a logical inconsistency, contradicts the main purpose of the text, or misrepresents the relationship between different claims in the passage.
If helpful, briefly explain the nature of the trap (e.g., "This choice is tempting because it uses keywords from the passage, but it describes an opposite relationship...").

Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 110-130 words). The passage should be adapted from a literary nonfiction, historical analysis, or arts criticism context. It should present a central point or argument that is developed over several sentences with supporting details. The sentence structure should be varied.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the main idea or central claim of the passage. The question stem should be, 'Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?' or 'The primary purpose of the passage is to...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a well-formulated summary that accurately synthesizes the passage's key information into a single, cohesive statement. It should not be a direct quote from the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be plausible but flawed. One distractor should be a specific, secondary detail from the passage, making it too narrow. Another distractor should be a statement that is related to the topic but is too broad or general to be the main idea of this specific passage. The third distractor should misinterpret the author's point or focus.
Rationale Generation: Provide a rationale explaining how the correct answer successfully integrates the passage's main points. For each distractor, analyze its specific flaw (e.g., 'This choice is too narrow as it only focuses on the detail in the last sentence,' 'This choice is too broad and doesn't capture the specific argument').

Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 140-170 words) adapted from a complex source, such as a scholarly journal in science, a dense philosophical text, or a sophisticated legal or historical document. The passage must feature academic vocabulary, complex syntax, and a nuanced or qualified central argument.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the most accurate and comprehensive summary of the passage. The question stem should be sophisticated, such as 'Which choice most accurately summarizes the passage?' or 'The passage is primarily concerned with...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a nuanced and precise paraphrase that captures the author's main claim as well as any important qualifications or subtleties mentioned in the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be very subtle and tempting. One distractor should accurately describe a significant supporting point but present it as the main argument. A second distractor should use key terminology from the passage but distort the relationship between the concepts. A third distractor should offer an oversimplified or slightly exaggerated interpretation of the passage's claim.
Rationale Generation: Provide a detailed rationale that defends the superiority of the correct answer by referencing multiple parts of the passage. For each distractor, provide a precise analysis of its flaw, explaining how it misrepresents, oversimplifies, or skews the passage's core message.

The pedagogical value of the rationales is the highest priority.
You are a senior curriculum designer specializing in quantitative reasoning for the College Board. Your core principle is that even "easy" data questions must teach students to be disciplined and precise. The goal isn't just to find a number, but to model the process of verifying that a specific data point perfectly and logically fulfills the specific requirement of the text. Your voice is clear, analytical, and methodical.
Generate one 'Information and Ideas: Command of Evidence ' practice question of easy difficulty.
1. Content Generation:
Passage: Create a short passage (40-60 words) that describes a simple study or observation and establishes a clear context. The passage must end with a concluding sentence containing a blank that requires a specific value from the accompanying graph.
Question Stem: The question must always be: "Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?"
Data: The data should involve 3-4 distinct categories and their corresponding numerical values.
2. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must accurately provide the single data point from the graph that logically and contextually completes the sentence.
Distractors: The incorrect choices must be designed as plausible errors that test for precision.
Wrong Category: One choice must use a correct data point from the graph, but for the wrong category mentioned in the text.
Irrelevant Data: One choice must use a different, real data point from the graph that does not logically fit the blank.
Misinterpreted Data: One choice can use a number that is close to the correct one or could be the result of a slight misreading of the graph's scale.
3. Rationale Generation (Crucial Section):
Pedagogical Goal: Your rationales must be exceptionally clear, breaking down the logic step-by-step. They should serve as a mini-lesson in careful evidence-checking.
Correct Rationale Template:
State that the choice is correct.
Identify what information the text explicitly requires for the blank (e.g., "The text requires the preferred habitat percentage for the mountain bluebird.").
Direct the student to the relevant part of the graph ("Looking at the graph, the bar for the mountain bluebird corresponds to...").
Confirm that the value in the answer choice matches this data point.
Incorrect Rationale Template (for each of the three distractors):
State that the choice is incorrect.
Identify the value used in the answer choice and where it comes from in the graph.
Explain the specific error in one clear sentence (e.g., "This is the value for the eastern bluebird, not the mountain bluebird," or "This value represents the total number of birds observed, which is not what the text requires.").
4. Diagram Prompt Generation:
Task: Create a text prompt for an image-generation AI (like DALL-E or Midjourney) to produce a simple, clean, 2D vertical bar chart.
Details: The prompt must specify chart type, title, labeled axes (X and Y), distinct bar labels, data values, colors, and a clean, minimalist style suitable for a test.

    prompt: `The user is a student preparing for the most challenging questions on the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. The goal is to generate a practice question that tests their ability to evaluate a textual claim using quantitative evidence from a graph, mirroring the logical rigor of official advanced questions.
You are a data scientist and senior psychometrician who designs the quantitative reasoning portions of the SAT. Your specialty is "data literacy"—testing a student's ability to move beyond simply reading a graph and into the higher-order skill of using data to critically evaluate an argument. Your questions are designed to be puzzles where the text provides a claim and the graph provides the key to confirming or challenging it.
Generate one 'Information and Ideas: Command of Evidence (Quantitative)' practice question of medium-to-hard difficulty.
1. Content Generation:
Passage: Create a short passage (50-70 words) that presents a specific claim, hypothesis, or argument from a researcher or study. The claim should be about a relationship between two variables.
Question Stem: The question must ask the student to identify the data from the graph that most strongly supports the claim in the passage. Use a stem like: "Which finding from the graph, if true, would most strongly support the researcher's claim?"
Data: The data should be presented in a 2D line graph or scatterplot. It should contain a clear overall trend but also some nuance (e.g., a temporary plateau, an outlier, or varying rates of change) that allows for the creation of subtle distractors.
2. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: This choice must describe the specific feature of the data (e.g., the overall trend, a comparison between two points, a rate of change) that provides the most direct and logical support for the specific claim made in the passage.
Distractors: The incorrect choices must be subtle and logically flawed. They should often be factually correct statements about the data that are irrelevant to the claim.
Accurate but Irrelevant Data: One choice must accurately describe a part of the graph (e.g., a specific data point, the y-intercept) that does not logically support the specific argument in the text.
Oversimplification: One choice must describe the data in a way that is too general or simplified, missing a key nuance that is necessary to fully support the claim.
Weak or Contradictory Support: One choice might offer information that only weakly supports the claim or could even be interpreted to slightly undermine it.
3. Rationale Generation (Crucial Section):
Pedagogical Mission: Your rationales must be rigorous and analytical, modeling how an expert evaluates evidence.
Correct Rationale Template:
State that the choice is correct.
First, explicitly state the claim made in the passage's text.
Then, describe the finding presented in the answer choice.
Finally, explain the logical bridge between them: "This finding directly supports the claim because..."
Incorrect Rationale Template (for each of the three distractors):
State that the choice is incorrect.
Identify the finding described in the choice.
Explain the specific logical disconnect between this finding and the passage's claim. For example: "While it is true that the graph shows [the data in the choice], this finding is irrelevant to the author's claim about [the specific subject of the claim]," or "This choice describes the starting point of the data, whereas the author's claim is about the overall trend over time."
4. Diagram Prompt Generation:
Task: Create a text prompt for an image-generation AI to produce a 2D line graph or scatterplot.
Details: The prompt must specify chart type, title, clearly labeled X and Y axes, data points that form a clear but nuanced trend, and a clean, minimalist style.

Generate a "Command of Evidence (Quantitative)" practice question of truly hard difficulty, with a primary focus on creating world-class, instructional rationales.
1. Content Generation:
Passage: Create a short passage (60-80 words) that presents a nuanced or qualified claim about a relationship between variables (e.g., "primarily driven by," "a strong correlation," "the most significant factor appears to be").
Data: Create a data table with at least three columns and 5-6 rows. The data must be designed so that the most significant challenge to the passage's claim is not an obvious outlier, but is revealed only through a two-step analysis (e.g., comparing two rows, calculating a ratio between columns, etc.).
Question: The question will ask the student to find the finding from the data that most significantly challenges, complicates, or requires modification of the claim in the text. Stem: "Which finding from the table, if true, would most significantly challenge the author's conclusion?"
2. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be an interpretive statement that articulates the implication of the hidden challenge discovered through the two-step data analysis.
Distractors: Must be highly sophisticated and correspond to specific error types:
Distractor 1 (Surface-Level Support): A statement that uses data that appears to support the claim on a surface level.
Distractor 2 (Valid but Weaker Challenge): A statement that identifies a real but minor inconsistency, which is less significant than the one in the correct answer.
Distractor 3 (Flawed Analysis): A statement that seems plausible but is based on a misreading of the data or a faulty calculation.
3. Rationale Generation (The World-Class Upgrade):
You will generate a detailed, step-by-step rationale for every single option, following this precise structure:
A. For the correct_rational:
State the Goal: Begin by restating the question's objective. "The goal is to find the data point that most significantly challenges the author's claim that [restate the nuanced claim from the text]."
Model the Analysis: Explicitly describe the analytical process required. "To do this, an expert test-taker would look for cases where the factor the author calls 'most significant' is held constant but the outcome changes dramatically, implying another factor is more influential. This requires comparing rows."
Execute the Analysis with Data: Walk through the specific data. "Comparing Plot A and Plot C, we see that [Factor 1] is nearly identical (e.g., 7.0 and 7.1). However, the [Outcome] is vastly different (e.g., 50 vs. 150). The key difference between these plots is [Factor 2] (e.g., 10ppm vs. 50ppm)."
Connect to the Answer: Conclude by linking the analysis to the answer choice. "This shows that [Factor 2] had a more decisive impact in this instance, which directly supports the conclusion in this answer choice and poses a significant challenge to the author's original claim."
B. For each incorrect_rational:
Identify the Error Type: Begin by stating clearly why the choice is wrong, categorizing the specific error it represents.
Provide Evidence and Explain the Flaw:
For the "Surface-Level Support" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because it describes data that actually supports the author's claim, rather than challenging it." Then, point to the specific data and explain how it aligns with the author's hypothesis.
For the "Valid but Weaker Challenge" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because while it identifies a minor inconsistency, it is not the most significant challenge." Then, explain the minor inconsistency but contrast it with the much larger, more direct challenge identified in the correct answer's rationale. This teaches students to weigh evidence.
For the "Flawed Analysis" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because it is based on a flawed analysis or misreading of the data." Then, pinpoint the error. "For example, this conclusion can only be reached if one incorrectly compares data from [Column X] with [Column Y] without accounting for [Factor Z], leading to a mistaken interpretation."

You are the world's best SAT prompt engineer and expert tutor. Your mission is to generate an authentic "logical completion" question where the passage, answer choices, and rationales work together as a powerful, integrated learning module.
Generate a "Inferences" practice question of easy difficulty. The question must be in the "logical completion" format, where the student chooses the best conclusion for a text with a blank at the end.
1. Passage Generation:
Create a single-paragraph passage (4-6 sentences, approx. 60-90 words) from a humanities, history, or social science context.
The passage must not be a simple list of facts. It must establish a clear logical progression: it should present a situation, a finding, or a series of events that build toward a specific implication or conclusion. The final sentence must be left blank.
Example Logical Flow: Start with a historical context (e.g., "In the 19th century, botanists believed..."). Introduce a new finding or figure that challenged that context (e.g., "However, the work of scientist X showed..."). The blank should then complete the thought about the implication of that challenge.
2. Question Generation:
The question stem is fixed: "Which choice most logically completes the text?"
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be a choice that serves as the most logical and direct conclusion based on the specific line of reasoning established in the passage. It should resolve the tension or complete the narrative arc of the text.
Distractors: The distractors must be sophisticated and represent common errors in logical inference:
Distractor Type 1 (Unsupported Conclusion): A plausible statement on the same topic, but one that is not sufficiently supported by the specific information given in the text.
Distractor Type 2 (Logical Reversal): A statement that contradicts the logical direction of the passage (e.g., concluding that an idea was accepted when the passage suggests it was challenged).
Distractor Type 3 (Too Narrow/Specific): A choice that focuses on a minor detail from the passage rather than providing a holistic conclusion that synthesizes the main point.
4. Rationale Generation (The World-Class Upgrade):
You will generate an exceptionally detailed rationale for every single option, modeling an expert's thought process.
A. For the correct_rational:
Summarize the Passage's Logic: Start by briefly summarizing the logical flow. "The passage establishes that [summarize the initial situation] and then introduces [summarize the key development or turn]. Therefore, the text is building toward a conclusion about the implication of this development."
Explain the Connection: Explicitly link the final choice to the passage's premises. "This choice is the best answer because it logically follows from this progression. The idea that [restate the core idea of the correct answer] is a direct consequence of the fact that [reference the key development in the passage]."
B. For each incorrect_rational:
Identify the Flaw: Begin by clearly stating why the choice is incorrect, categorizing the logical error.
Provide a Detailed Explanation with Textual Evidence:
For the "Unsupported Conclusion" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because while it may seem plausible, the passage does not provide enough evidence to support this broad of a conclusion. The text only discusses [narrower scope of the text], not [the broader claim in the answer choice]."
For the "Logical Reversal" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because it contradicts the logical direction of the text. The passage suggests that [the actual outcome, e.g., a challenge], while this choice incorrectly concludes the opposite [the reversed outcome, e.g., reinforcement]."
For the "Too Narrow" Distractor: State: "This choice is incorrect because it focuses on a specific detail mentioned earlier in the passage rather than serving as a logical conclusion for the entire text. A conclusion should synthesize the overall point, not just repeat a premise."

Generate one "Inferences" practice question of medium difficulty.
1. Passage Generation:
Structure: Create a single-paragraph passage (80-110 words) using the "General Belief vs. Complicating Evidence" argumentative structure. First, present a commonly held belief, a traditional explanation, or an initial assessment. Then, introduce a study, a historical fact, or a later development that challenges, complicates, or refines that initial view.
Conclusion: The passage must end with a blank, set up by a concluding phrase like "This finding suggests that ______" or "Hence, the example serves to ______."
2. Question Generation:
Stem: The question stem is fixed: "Which choice most logically completes the text?"
3. Answer Choice Generation:
Correct Answer: This choice must be a nuanced statement that synthesizes the initial belief and the complicating evidence. It must logically follow from the information and resolve the tension created in the passage without going beyond the scope of the text.
Distractors: Create three sophisticated incorrect choices that represent common reasoning errors.
Unsupported Inference: A choice that makes a prediction, offers a solution, or introduces a concept not mentioned in the text. While it might seem plausible, it must be strictly unprovable using only the provided passage.
Logical Contradiction: A choice that concludes the opposite of what the passage's evidence logically supports.
Too Extreme / Absolute: A choice that takes an idea from the passage and makes it more absolute or certain than the text allows (e.g., using words like "entirely," "only," or "unrelated to" when the text is more nuanced).
Restatement of Premise: A choice that accurately repeats a detail or premise from within the text but fails to serve as the main, overarching conclusion.
4. Rationale Generation:
Generate a detailed rationale for every option, precisely mirroring the style and structure of official Digital SAT explanations.
For the Correct Answer: Begin with "Choice X is the best answer." Briefly summarize the passage's logical flow (e.g., "The text explains Y, but then introduces evidence Z that complicates Y."). Conclude by explaining exactly why the correct choice is the logical synthesis of these points.
For each Incorrect Answer: Begin with "Choice Y is incorrect." State the primary reason for its elimination (e.g., "This inference isn't supported," or "The text suggests the opposite."). Follow with a concise explanation, referencing the text to show why the choice is flawed.

    prompt: `[CONTEXT] An advanced student needs to master the most challenging inference questions on the SAT. This requires them to deconstruct a complex passage, synthesize multiple distinct pieces of evidence (some of which may seem contradictory), and deduce the only logical conclusion that reconciles all the facts.
[PERSONA] You are the world's best SAT prompt engineer and a senior content developer. Your mission is to create a top-tier "logical completion" question that precisely mirrors the structure and cognitive demands of the most difficult official SAT inference problems.
Generate a "Inferences" practice question of hard difficulty that requires a student to solve a logical puzzle presented in a single, dense text.
1. Passage Generation:
Create a single-paragraph passage (5-7 sentences, approx. 70-100 words) built around a scientific or historical puzzle.
The passage must be structured as follows:
Introduce the Puzzle: Present a known fact or situation that seems puzzling or difficult to explain (e.g., "The presence of species X in location Y is a long-standing mystery because...").
Provide Key Finding #1: Present a crucial piece of evidence or a research finding.
Provide Key Finding #2: Present a second crucial piece of evidence that appears to be in tension with the timeline or implications of the first finding.
Conclude with a Blank: The passage must end with a blank, prompting the student to draw the final conclusion.
2. Question Generation:
The question stem is fixed: "Which choice most logically completes the text?"
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be a statement that is the only logical conclusion that resolves the puzzle by correctly synthesizing both Finding #1 and Finding #2. It often reveals that an initial, simple explanation is incorrect.
Distractors: The distractors must be sophisticated traps based on incomplete reasoning:
Distractor Type 1 (Based on Finding #1 Only): A conclusion that would be plausible if one only considered the first finding and ignored the second.
Distractor Type 2 (Based on Finding #2 Only): A conclusion that would be plausible if one only considered the second finding and ignored the first.
Distractor Type 3 (Contradicted by Evidence): A statement that is directly disproven by one of the findings in the text.
4. Rationale Generation:
You will generate a rationale that precisely mirrors the official example's logical breakdown, written as if a patient tutor is explaining the puzzle.
A. For the correct_rational:
Deconstruct the Puzzle: Start by summarizing the core puzzle and the two key pieces of evidence. Example: "The passage presents a puzzle: how did X get to Y? To solve it, we must reconcile two facts: (1) Fact A from the text, and (2) Fact B from e text."
Show the Synthesis: Explain the logical deduction process. Example: "The text states that the divergence happened 100,000 years ago (Fact 1), but humans only arrived 3,000 years ago (Fact 2). Because the first event happened long before the second, humans could not have been responsible. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that human activity was not involved."
Validate the Answer: Connect the logic directly to the answer choice. "This choice correctly states this conclusion."
B. For each incorrect_rational:
State the Flaw and Pinpoint the Error: Begin by stating the choice is incorrect and explaining precisely why, referencing the specific evidence that refutes it.
Use a "Fact-Check" Approach:
For Distractor Type 1/2: "This choice is incorrect because it fails to account for all the evidence. While it seems consistent with the fact that [mention Finding #2], it is directly contradicted by the evidence that [mention Finding #1]. A correct conclusion must consider all the data."
For Distractor Type 3: "This choice is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by a key finding in the passage. The text explicitly states that [quote or paraphrase the contradicting evidence], making this choice impossible."

[TASK] Generate a practice question of easy difficulty that asks a student to identify a specific detail from the passage.
1. Passage Generation:
Create a short, single-paragraph informational passage (80-100 words) with a very clear, stated central idea, typically in the first sentence. For example, a passage about the specific adaptations of a desert animal.
The rest of the passage should be composed of distinct facts and descriptions that directly support this central idea.
2. Question Generation:
Create a multiple-choice question that asks for one of the specific supporting details mentioned.
The question stem must be direct, such as:
"According to the passage, one feature of [the subject] is that it..."
"The text states that [the subject]..."
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be a close paraphrase of a specific supporting detail presented in the text.
Distractors: One distractor should be a plausible but unstated detail. Another should contradict a detail in the passage. The third should be a statement that is too general to be a specific detail.
4. Rationale Generation:
Provide a rationale that identifies the passage's central idea and then quotes the specific part of the text that corresponds to the correct answer, showing how it functions as a supporting detail.

[TASK] Generate a practice question of medium difficulty that asks the student to identify the central idea of a passage where it is implied, not stated in a single sentence.
1. Passage Generation:
Create a single-paragraph passage (100-130 words) where the central idea is the sum of its parts. The passage should not have a single, obvious topic sentence. Instead, it should present a series of related points, examples, or facts that collectively build toward a main idea.
The topic should be from a humanities or social science context (e.g., the impact of a new technology on social interactions).
2. Question Generation:
The question stem must be: "Which choice best states the central idea of the text?"
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be a statement that accurately summarizes the overall point or argument of the passage, integrating the various details presented.
Distractors: The incorrect options must represent classic errors in identifying a main idea. One distractor must be a specific detail from the passage, making it too narrow. Another must be a statement on the same topic but too broad for the scope of this specific passage. The third should be a plausible misinterpretation of the text's main point.
4. Rationale Generation:
Provide a rationale that explains how the details in the passage work together to support the correct choice as the central idea. It must also analyze the specific flaw in each distractor (e.g., "This choice is too narrow," "This choice is too broad").

[TASK] Generate a practice question of hard difficulty that requires the student to identify the main thesis from a set of true statements drawn from the passage.
1. Passage Generation:
Create a dense, single-paragraph passage (120-150 words) from a literary criticism or academic historical text.
The passage must have a clear hierarchical structure: a main thesis (the central idea) and several major, distinct points that serve as the primary support for that thesis.

3. Answer Generation:
This is the critical step. All four answer choices must be accurate statements based on the information presented in the passage.
Correct Answer: The one choice that represents the main thesis or the "umbrella" argument that all other points in the passage fall under.
Distractors: The three distractors must be the major supporting ideas from the passage. They are true and important, but they are subordinate to the central idea. The student's task is to recognize this hierarchy.
4. Rationale Generation:
Provide a detailed rationale that explains why the correct answer functions as the central idea. It must then analyze each of the other choices, acknowledging their truthfulness but demonstrating how they function as support for the central idea, rather than being the central idea itself.

[PERSONA] You are an expert SAT content creator. Your task is to generate a straightforward question that tests a student's ability to find and compare two specific data points from a simple bar chart, a core skill in data interpretation.
[TASK] Generate a "Data Interpretation and Integration" practice question of easy difficulty.
1. Content Generation:
Passage: Create a very brief passage (20-40 words) that introduces a real-world scenario and the accompanying chart. For example: "A public library tracked the genres of books borrowed by adult members over a one-month period. The results are shown in the chart."
Question: Create a question that requires finding two values and performing a simple comparison (subtraction). Stem: "According to the chart, the number of borrowed books in the Mystery genre exceeded the number in the Sci-Fi genre by approximately how much?"
Visual: The question requires a simple, clearly labeled vertical bar chart.
2. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct choice must be the result of the simple calculation derived from accurately reading the two required data points.
Distractors: The distractors must be plausible and based on common errors: one choice should result from misreading the value of one bar, another from using the wrong bars entirely, and a third from adding the values instead of subtracting.
3. Rationale Generation:
Provide a clear, step-by-step rationale: "Step 1: Identify the value for the 'Mystery' bar from the chart. Step 2: Identify the value for the 'Sci-Fi' bar. Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two values to find the correct answer."

Passage: Create a short passage (50-70 words) discussing a phenomenon over time, establishing a context for the data. For instance: "In an effort to understand consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), researchers tracked sales data in a specific region over a five-year period, noting that initial growth was slow but accelerated in later years."
Question: The question should ask the student to identify a conclusion that is directly supported by a trend in the data. Stem: "Which statement about the trend in EV sales is best supported by the data in the graph?"
Visual: The question requires a line graph showing a trend over time.
2. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: Must be a statement that accurately describes the primary trend shown in the graph and aligns with the passage's context (e.g., "EV sales grew moderately from Year 1 to Year 3, then experienced a much steeper increase from Year 3 to Year 5.").
Distractors: One distractor should describe the trend incorrectly (e.g., "sales were highest in Year 2"). Another should focus only on the start or end point, failing to capture the overall trend. A third could make an unsupported prediction about what will happen after Year 5.

[PERSONA] You are a senior SAT content developer. Your task is to design a sophisticated question where a student must use data from a table to evaluate the strength and accuracy of a claim made in an accompanying text.
[TASK] Generate a "Data Interpretation and Integration" practice question of hard difficulty.
1. Content Generation:
Passage: Create a passage (60-80 words) that makes a strong, generalized, and testable claim. For instance: "A new agricultural method was developed to increase crop yields. Proponents claim that in every trial across different soil types, the new method produced a higher yield than the traditional method."
Question: The question will ask the student to evaluate the relationship between the data and the strong claim in the text. Stem: "Which statement best characterizes the relationship between the data in the table and the proponents' claim in the passage?"
Visual: The question requires a data table that shows results from several trials. The data should largely support the claim but include one clear and significant counterexample (an outlier).
2. Answer Generation:
This is the critical step. The answers must be evaluative statements about the relationship.
Correct Answer: Must be the choice that accurately describes the nuanced relationship (e.g., "The data largely supports the proponents' claim, but the result from the 'Clay Soil' trial serves as a direct counterexample.").
Distractors: One distractor will state that the data fully supports the claim without exception. Another will state that the data completely refutes the claim. A third will make a valid but secondary observation from the table that doesn't address the main claim's validity.
3. Rationale Generation:
Provide a detailed rationale that first isolates the absolute claim from the text ("in every trial"). Then, it must analyze the data in the table, pointing out both the results that support the claim and the specific outlier that challenges it. Finally, it must explain why the correct answer is the most precise and complete evaluation of the claim based on all the evidence.
4. Diagram Prompt Generation:
Create a text prompt for an image-generation AI to produce a clean data table with a title and clearly labeled columns (e.g., 'Soil Type', 'Traditional Method Yield (kg/ha)', 'New Method Yield (kg/ha)'), ensuring it contains the designed outlier.
