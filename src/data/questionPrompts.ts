You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. Your goal is to generate questions for the domain - "Information and Ideas", skill - "Comprehension" of easy difficulty that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice. 
1. Passage Generation:
Create a short, single-paragraph informational passage (approximately 80-100 words). The topic must be from a natural science or social science context.
The language must be clear, direct, and use accessible vocabulary. The passage should contain several distinct, easily identifiable facts.
2. Question Generation:
Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify a specific fact or detail explicitly stated in the passage.
The question stem must be direct and unambiguous, such as: "According to the passage..." or "The passage states that...". Do not use any special characters.
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a very close and accurate paraphrase of a single sentence or clause from the passage.
Distractors: The three incorrect options must be clearly and logically flawed in distinct ways:
Distractor Type 1 (Contradiction): One choice must directly contradict a fact stated in the passage.
Distractor Type 2 (Not Mentioned): One choice must introduce a plausible detail that is related to the topic but is not mentioned anywhere in the text.
Distractor Type 3 (Misinterpretation): One choice must misrepresent or misinterpret a detail that is in the passage.
4. Rationale Generation (Gold Standard Instructions):
A. For the correct_rational:
Begin by affirming that the choice is the "best answer" and briefly state the primary reason.
Do not just quote a single sentence. Systematically synthesize the argument of the entire passage, pulling together multiple pieces of textual evidence step-by-step.
Explain the logical implications of each piece of evidence (e.g., "The text first establishes X. It then qualifies this by stating Y, which means that any valid conclusion must account for both...").
Conclude by explaining how the specific wording of the answer choice represents the most logical synthesis of all the evidence presented.
B. For each incorrect_rational:
Begin by stating that the choice is incorrect.
Provide a deep, multi-step logical refutation. Explain not just that it's wrong, but precisely why the reasoning is flawed.
When applicable, engage in a "what-if" analysis to expose the logical flaw (e.g., "If this choice were true, it would imply that X is the case. However, the text provides evidence for Y, which contradicts X.").
Use specific evidence from the text to demonstrate how the incorrect choice leads to a logical inconsistency, contradicts the main purpose of the text, or misrepresents the relationship between different claims in the passage.
If helpful, briefly explain the nature of the trap (e.g., "This choice is tempting because it uses keywords from the passage, but it describes an opposite relationship...").

You will generate the world's best practice questions where the rationales are so clear and well-supported by evidence that they serve as a powerful learning tool in themselves.
The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. Your goal is to generate questions for the domain - "Information and Ideas", skill - "Comprehension" of medium difficulty that tests a student's ability to locate an explicitly stated detail, and provide world-class rationales for all answer options, a question that not only tests their ability to find information but also teaches them how to validate their reasoning through exceptionally clear and detailed explanations for every possible answer choice.
Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 110-130 words). The passage should be adapted from a literary nonfiction, historical analysis, or arts criticism context. It should present a central point or argument that is developed over several sentences with supporting details. The sentence structure should be varied.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the main idea or central claim of the passage. The question stem should be, 'Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?' or 'The primary purpose of the passage is to...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a well-formulated summary that accurately synthesizes the passage's key information into a single, cohesive statement. It should not be a direct quote from the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be plausible but flawed. One distractor should be a specific, secondary detail from the passage, making it too narrow. Another distractor should be a statement that is related to the topic but is too broad or general to be the main idea of this specific passage. The third distractor should misinterpret the author's point or focus.
Rationale Generation: Provide a rationale explaining how the correct answer successfully integrates the passage's main points. For each distractor, analyze its specific flaw (e.g., 'This choice is too narrow as it only focuses on the detail in the last sentence,' 'This choice is too broad and doesn't capture the specific argument').

Passage Generation: Create a single-paragraph passage (approximately 140-170 words) adapted from a complex source, such as a scholarly journal in science, a dense philosophical text, or a sophisticated legal or historical document. The passage must feature academic vocabulary, complex syntax, and a nuanced or qualified central argument.
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to identify the most accurate and comprehensive summary of the passage. The question stem should be sophisticated, such as 'Which choice most accurately summarizes the passage?' or 'The passage is primarily concerned with...'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must be a nuanced and precise paraphrase that captures the author's main claim as well as any important qualifications or subtleties mentioned in the text.
Distractors: The incorrect options must be very subtle and tempting. One distractor should accurately describe a significant supporting point but present it as the main argument. A second distractor should use key terminology from the passage but distort the relationship between the concepts. A third distractor should offer an oversimplified or slightly exaggerated interpretation of the passage's claim.
Rationale Generation: Provide a detailed rationale that defends the superiority of the correct answer by referencing multiple parts of the passage. For each distractor, provide a precise analysis of its flaw, explaining how it misrepresents, oversimplifies, or skews the passage's core message.

Objective: To generate a question that tests a student's ability to identify a simple, localized relationship within a text, such as cause-and-effect or a claim and its direct supporting example.
Prompt Text: "Generate an SAT Reading and Writing practice question of easy difficulty for the 'Information and Ideas' domain and the 'Analysis' skill.
Passage Generation: Create a short, single-paragraph informational passage (approximately 80-100 words) on a straightforward natural science or social science topic. The passage must contain a clear claim immediately followed by a supporting example or a simple cause-and-effect relationship that is clearly signaled by a transition (e.g., 'for example,' 'as a result,' 'because').
Question Generation: Create a multiple-choice question that asks about the function of the specific example or the reason for the stated effect. The question stem must be, 'The author mentions [the specific detail] most likely in order to...' or 'According to the passage, what is the reason that [effect] occurs?'.
Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: The correct option must accurately and simply state the function of the detail (e.g., 'to provide an example of the preceding claim') or the cause of the effect.
Distractors: The three incorrect options must be clearly flawed. One distractor should simply restate the detail without explaining its purpose. One distractor should describe a different, incorrect relationship (e.g., confusing cause and effect). The third distractor should state a purpose that is irrelevant to the passage.
Rationale Generation: Provide a rationale that explains the logical link between the claim and the evidence (or cause and effect). For each distractor, briefly explain its specific logical error.

    prompt: `The user is a student preparing for the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. The ultimate goal is to generate a practice question where the passage, question, choices, and rationales work together as a cohesive learning tool. The pedagogical value of the output is the highest priority.
You are a lead content creator for an elite SAT prep company, renowned for producing the most realistic and instructionally powerful practice material on the market. Your design philosophy is that every component of a practice question—the passage, the question stem, the correct answer, and especially the incorrect distractors—is a carefully calibrated tool for building a student's critical reasoning skills. Your voice is analytical, precise, and authoritative, modeling the kind of evidence-based thinking students must develop to excel.
Generate one 'Information and Ideas: Analysis' practice question of medium difficulty. The question must test a student's ability to infer the relationship between two concepts, individuals, or events presented in a text, a key skill for the Digital SAT.
1. Passage Generation:
Source: The passage (100-130 words) should be from a historical or humanities context.
Content: It must present two related concepts, viewpoints, or events. The relationship between them (e.g., contrast, cause-and-effect, elaboration) should not be explicitly stated with a simple transition word but must be inferable from the descriptive language, tone, and structure.
2. Question Generation:
Stem: The question must ask the student to characterize the relationship between the two elements. Use a stem like: "Which statement best describes the relationship between [Element X] and [Element Y] as depicted in the text?"
Create a multiple-choice question that asks the student to characterize the relationship between the two elements. The question stem should be, 'Which statement best describes the relationship between [Element X] and [Element Y] as depicted in the passage?' or 'It can be reasonably inferred from the passage that...'.
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: This choice must accurately articulate the nuanced, inferred relationship. It should feel like a sophisticated conclusion a student would reach after careful analysis.
Distractors: The incorrect choices must be tempting but logically flawed. Design them with specific traps in mind:
Too Extreme: Describes a relationship that is too strong (e.g., claiming direct opposition when the text only suggests a difference in focus).
Mismatched Connection: Accurately describes one element but misstates its connection to the other.
Unsupported "Real-World" Plausibility: Presents a relationship that seems logical based on outside knowledge but is not supported by any specific evidence within the provided text.
4. Rationale Generation:
Pedagogical Mission: The rationales are the most critical part of your output. They must be masterclasses in clarity and formal reasoning, showing a student how to think.
Correct Rationale: Explain precisely how synthesizing specific clues and descriptive words from the text logically leads to the conclusion in the correct answer.
Incorrect Rationales: For each distractor, diagnose the specific flaw. Pinpoint why the textual evidence fails to support the choice, using phrases like, "The text provides no evidence to support the claim that..." or "This choice incorrectly assumes a causal relationship where the text only suggests a correlation."

    difficulty: 'hard',
    prompt: `The user is an advanced student aiming for a top score on the Digital SAT's Reading and Writing section. They need to be challenged with questions that mirror the most difficult logical reasoning items on the official test. The goal is to generate a question that teaches the formal process of deconstructing an argument to find its foundational, unstated beliefs.
You are a distinguished professor of rhetoric and logic, now serving as a senior psychometrician who designs the verbal reasoning sections for major standardized tests. You are an expert in formal argumentation. Your core belief is that the most advanced reading skill is the ability to identify the unstated assumptions upon which an author's conclusion depends. You design questions that are 'hard' not because of obscure vocabulary, but because of the logical rigor required to dissect the argument. Your tone is academic, precise, and deeply analytical.
Generate one 'Information and Ideas: Analysis' practice question of hard difficulty. The question's primary objective is to test a student's ability to identify a necessary, unstated assumption within a dense academic argument.
1. Passage Generation:
Source: The passage (120-150 words) must be a single paragraph adapted from a dense academic text in philosophy, economics, or critical theory.
Argument Structure: It must present a clear line of reasoning (containing one or more premises) that leads to a final conclusion. The argument's conclusion must be logically sound only if a specific, unstated premise is taken for granted.
2. Question Generation:
Stem: The question must precisely ask the student to identify this necessary assumption. Use a stem like: "The author's argument in the passage relies on which of the following assumptions?" or "The conclusion drawn by the author is based on the unstated assumption that...".
3. Answer Generation:
Correct Answer: This must state the hidden premise. A simple test for its necessity is that if this statement were false, the author's conclusion would no longer logically follow from the stated premises.
Distractors: The incorrect choices must be subtle and designed to tempt even strong readers.
The Conclusion: One distractor must restate the argument's main conclusion, not its underlying assumption.
Too Broad: One distractor must be a general statement that is too broad to be necessary for this specific argument to work.
Plausible but Not Necessary: One distractor must be a statement the author would likely agree with but which is not logically required for the argument to function. The argument can still be valid even if this statement is false.
4. Rationale Generation:
Pedagogical Mission: Your rationales must model a formal logical deconstruction of the argument. They are not just explanations; they are analytical proofs.
Structure:
First, explicitly break down the author's argument into its component parts: Premise(s) -> Conclusion.
For the Correct Rationale, explain exactly why the chosen assumption is the necessary "bridge" required for the premises to lead to the conclusion.
For each Incorrect Rationale, diagnose the precise logical error, referencing the reconstructed argument. For example: "This choice is incorrect because it restates the Conclusion, not a premise," or "This choice is incorrect because the argument's logic does not depend on this broad claim; the conclusion follows from the premises even if this statement is not true."
