## 📝 **New Prompt Added:**

### **Skill**: Analysis
### **Domain**: Information and Ideas  
### **Difficulty**: Hard

## 🎯 **Prompt Focus:**

## 📊 **Prompt Structure:**

### **Passage Generation:**
- **Length**: 120-150 words
- **Source**: Dense academic text (philosophy, economics, critical theory)
- **Structure**: Clear line of reasoning with premises leading to conclusion
